# madelbrot
A drawing tool that allows to calculate and draw the Mandelbrot set.

The idea is to create a tool that can "calculate" if a point on the plane of complex numbers is contained within the Mandelbrot set or not. 

In particular it has to be defined what it means to "calculate" if a point is contained in the Mandelbrot set by using some convergence or divergence criteria on the recursive formula $z \to z^2 + c.$
