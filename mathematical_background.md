# Mathematical Background on the Mandelbrot Set

## 1 The Field of Complex Numbers $\mathbb{C}$

### 1.1 Motivation and Introduction

The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ form the foundation of classical mathematics, especially in school-level education. However, we encounter certain equations for which $\mathbb{R}$ is insufficient. A classic example is:
$$
x^2 + 1 = 0
$$
This equation has no solution in $\mathbb{R}$ because the square of a real number can never be negative. To find a solution, we must expand our number system. This leads to the introduction of a new number: the **imaginary unit** $i$, defined by
$$
i^2 = -1
$$
This allows us to define the so-called **complex numbers**. This extension is not only useful but a foundational basis for numerous disciplines, from electrical engineering and quantum mechanics to fractal geometry.

### 1.2 Definition of Complex Numbers

A complex number has the form
$$
z = x + iy
$$
with $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$. Here, $x$ is the **real part** and $y$ the **imaginary part** of $z$. The set of all complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{C}$.

Complex numbers can be represented as points in the so-called **complex plane** (also known as the Argand diagram): the x-axis represents the real part, and the y-axis the imaginary part.

### 1.3 Arithmetic Operations

The arithmetic rules for complex numbers extend the familiar rules:

- **Addition**: $$(x + iy) + (u + iv) = (x + u) + i(y + v)$$
- **Multiplication**:
  $$(x + iy)(u + iv) = (xu - yv) + i(xv + yu)$$

These rules follow directly from the definition $i^2 = -1$.

### 1.4 Conjugation and Norm

- The **complex conjugate** of $z = x + iy$ is $$\bar{z} = x - iy$$
- The **norm** (or **magnitude**) of a complex number is defined by:
  $$
  |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
  $$
  This corresponds to the distance of the point $z$ from the origin in the complex plane (Euclidean norm).

### 1.5 Example: Evaluating a Complex Expression

Let us consider the expression:
$$
c = 2 + 3i - \sqrt{5} i^5 - \frac{5}{3}
$$
First, recall the powers of the imaginary unit:
- $i^1 = i$
- $i^2 = -1$
- $i^3 = -i$
- $i^4 = 1$
- $i^5 = i$

Thus:
$$
\sqrt{5}i^5 = \sqrt{5} \cdot i
$$

Substitute into the original expression:
$$
c = 2 + 3i - \sqrt{5} i - \frac{5}{3}
$$
Now combine the real parts:
$$
2 - \frac{5}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{5}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

And the imaginary parts:
$$
3i - \sqrt{5}i = (3 - \sqrt{5})i
$$

So we obtain:
$$
\boxed{c = \frac{1}{3} + (3 - \sqrt{5})i}
$$

This example demonstrates how complex numbers can be manipulated algebraically, and how an initially complicated expression can be reduced to a "simple" complex number.

Additionally, we can compute the norm of this number:
$$
|c| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + (3 - \sqrt{5})^2}
$$
This yields the distance of this point from the origin in the complex plane.

(The following sections remain unchanged and can be expanded in a similar manner upon request.)


## 2 Recursive Sequences of Complex Numbers

### 2.1 Sequences: A Brief Overview

A **sequence** is an ordered list of elements, typically numbers, indexed by the natural numbers. For example:
$$
a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots
$$
A **recursive** (or iterative) sequence is one where each term depends on previous terms. The simplest case is a first-order recursion:
$$
a_{n+1} = f(a_n)
$$
Given an initial value $a_0$, the whole sequence is generated by repeatedly applying $f$.

### 2.2 Recursive Sequences in $\mathbb{C}$

When the sequence terms lie in $\mathbb{C}$, we speak of a complex recursive sequence. A well-known example in fractal geometry is:
$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c, \quad z_0 = 0
$$
Here, $c$ is a fixed complex parameter. The behavior of this sequence, as $n \to \infty$, depends on the value of $c$.

## 3 Convergence and Divergence

### 3.1 Convergence

A sequence $\{z_n\}$ in $\mathbb{C}$ **converges** to $z \in \mathbb{C}$ if, for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n > N$, we have:
$$
|z_n - z| < \varepsilon
$$
That is, the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to $z$.

### 3.2 Divergence

A sequence **diverges** if it does not converge. One common form is when $|z_n| \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$. This means the terms move arbitrarily far away from the origin.

### 3.3 Examples

- **Convergent example**:
  $$
z_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}z_n, \quad z_0 = 1 \Rightarrow z_n = \frac{1}{2^n} \to 0
  $$

- **Divergent example**:
  $$
z_{n+1} = 2z_n, \quad z_0 = 1 \Rightarrow z_n = 2^n \to \infty
  $$

In the context of the Mandelbrot set, we are interested in whether the sequence $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ diverges.

## 4 The Iteration $z \mapsto z^2 + c$

### 4.1 The Function

We define the iteration:
$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c, \quad z_0 = 0
$$
This is a simple quadratic recurrence, yet it leads to extremely complex behavior.

### 4.2 Dynamics

The nature of the sequence depends on the value of $c$:
- For some $c$, the sequence stays bounded — i.e., $|z_n|$ remains finite.
- For other $c$, the sequence diverges to infinity.

We are particularly interested in the set of all $c$ such that the sequence does **not** diverge. This leads to the Mandelbrot set.

## 5 The Mandelbrot Set

### 5.1 Definition

The **Mandelbrot set** $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of all complex numbers $c$ such that the sequence
$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c, \quad z_0 = 0
$$
remains bounded:
$$
\mathcal{M} = \{c \in \mathbb{C} \mid \sup_n |z_n| < \infty \}
$$

### 5.2 Properties

- **Bounded**: All elements of $\mathcal{M}$ lie within the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
- **Connected**: The set is a single, unbroken whole.
- **Fractal boundary**: Zooming into the boundary reveals infinite complexity and self-similar structures.
- **Colorful representations**: When visualized, points inside the set are usually colored black, while points outside are shaded depending on how quickly their sequences diverge.

---

## 6 Julia Sets

### 6.1 Definition

Given a fixed complex number $c$, the **Julia set** $J_c$ is the boundary of the set of points $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ for which the sequence
$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
$$
is bounded.

### 6.2 Relationship to Mandelbrot Set

- If $c \in \mathcal{M}$, then $J_c$ is **connected**.
- If $c \notin \mathcal{M}$, then $J_c$ is **disconnected** (a "Cantor dust").

### 6.3 Visualization

Julia sets can be more or less complex depending on $c$. When $c = 0$, the Julia set is the unit circle. For other values, the shapes range from blobs to snowflake-like filaments.

---

## 7 Conclusion

The study of recursive sequences over complex numbers reveals deep mathematical structures. The Mandelbrot set is a window into these dynamics, displaying how a simple iterative rule — $z \mapsto z^2 + c$ — can lead to incredibly rich and varied behavior.

Understanding convergence, divergence, and the behavior of complex functions under iteration not only gives insight into abstract mathematics but also leads to beautiful and unexpected visual patterns in the world of fractals.
